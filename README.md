# React Prop Permutations for [Automated](https://github.com/automated-tools/automated)

Generate React component use-cases with prop permutations.

# What it does

* By default, only required props are permutated.
* If you are missing a default prop for a non-required prop, it will provide a
  value and treat is as if it were required.
